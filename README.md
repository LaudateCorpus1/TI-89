# TI-89

I've been writing programs in TI Basic since ~1998. For my Mechanical Engineering coursework I would study by writing programs. I found that by breaking down the problems by programming them I tricked myself into actually learning the material.

I recently found my TI-89s and pulled all of the files using tilp2.

The text versions were converted using [TI-Graph Link 89](https://education.ti.com/en/us/software/details/en/A2E9B3DFCB44490DBD5449E05721767D/ti-graph-link-for-windows) running under WINE.
